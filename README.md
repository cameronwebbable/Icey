Icey

Icey is a kanban board for your GitHub issues.

If [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com) and GitHub Issues had an illegitimate love child, it might look something like Icey.

About Icey
----------

Icey connects to your GitHub account and provides you with a familiar interface to your projects' issues. You can manage and prioritize issues across four columns: the Icebox, the Backlog, what's Currently being worked on and what's Completed. Open issues are managed using labels to tell Icey what column to put them in; Completed issues are automatically closed.

The first version of this app was built in a single day at Los Angeles' Node.js Boot Camp. Since then, it's been finessed and redesigned to non-destructively interact with your Github Issues and to work around existing labels. That said, use at your own risk.

Coming soon!
